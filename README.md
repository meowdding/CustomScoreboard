Custom Scoreboard is a mod for modern Minecraft and Hypixel SkyBlock, inspired by [SkyHanni](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyhanni).
This mod lets you fully customize your scoreboard, making it easier to focus on the information that matters most while you're running a
Dungeon, slaying a Voidgloom or grinding for a Mineshaft in a Party!

Using /customscoreboard, or /cs for short, you can open the config and start customizing your Custom Scoreboard experience!

### Transferring from SkyHanni

You can easily transfer your config by using the ``Transfer`` button under `/cs` -> `Mod Compatibility`.
Your old SkyHanni Custom Scoreboard Background Texturepack will work fine, you won't need to update it.
